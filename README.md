# Introduction

Eye tracking was taken into development around 100 years ago, though it can be implemented with other users, including those with disabilities. This small project has come to light after we initiated a detailed analysis through tests, questions, and surveys throughout the school.

This repository was made specifically for the ISSP Project dedicated to the Sri Sangwan School. Implemented by using the existing Eye Tracking software called [Beam Eye Tracker](), and utilize it for the gaze bubble to follow with the mouse.
