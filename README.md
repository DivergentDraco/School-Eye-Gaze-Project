# Introduction

Eye tracking was taken into development around 100 years ago, though it can be implemented with other users, including those with disabilities. This small project has come to light after we initiated a detailed analysis through tests, questions, and surveys throughout the school.

This repository was made specifically for the **ISSP Project** dedicated to the Sri Sangwan School. Implemented by using the existing Eye Tracking software called [**Beam Eye Tracker**](https://beam.eyeware.tech/), and utilizing it for the gaze bubble to follow with the mouse.

# Project Overview

**Sri Sangwan School** is an institution that provides inclusive education for children with disabilities. Our project mission is to assist them by making insightful research recommendations that will make digital education more accessible. Read more about Sri Sangwan School ([>>here<<](http://www.swn.ac.th/mainpage))

This project focuses on improving the well-being of Sri Sangwan School by providing research recommendations through surveys, interviews, classroom observations, and group study. Later on, we decided to research existing eye-tracking software and modify the existing [**API**](https://beam.eyeware.tech/developers/) written by said eye-tracking software developer.

The video includes our research and methodologies while working on the research recommendations that applied to this project later on.


## Our purpose and objective
The objective for this project is to try and see methods that can be used within Sri Sangwan School's computer science lab, which houses extraordinary students that has loss of limb, uncontrollable muscle, or Cerebral Palsy, etc.

## Beam Eye Tracker
Beam Eye Tracker is an eye tracker software that can be used with its existing [API](). Presenting a wide variety of functions, such as gaze tracking, integration with games, etc. The calibration and sensitivity can be controlled within its included UI.

### Coding language used

# Issues
Throughout the project, there are many issues coming up while attempting to use the eye tracking method.

- Eye fatigue  
 [Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFlightSim/comments/1ew95qh/does_anybody_actually_use_eye_tracking/)
| Many of eye tracking camera users disabled the eye tracking due to eye fatigue when used, later to use the head tracking function that comes with the software.

- Low Precision
 [Issues]()
  Experiencing cursor drifts while using the eye tracker

- Head tilt and movement calibration issues
 [Issues]()
